Ringbuffer
----------

One of the main goals of the LuckyLoop real-time-process is to calculate phase
and power of a specific frequency for a specific channel. To calculate phase
and power, we need more than a current sample. To achieve this, data is
collected by one of EtherCat slave devices and continually read in the EtherCat
main process into a ringbuffer.
